# testing-exercises
Here we have four exercises to warm up in testing. In addLength.js, we add the number of letters in any string. In reverseString.js, we reverse the letter order of any string. In calculator.js, we add, subtract, multiply and divide any two numbers. Finally, in capital.js, we capitalize the first letter of a string.
